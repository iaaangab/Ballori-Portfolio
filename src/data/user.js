		description:(
			<>
I am a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science student at Mapúa Malayan Colleges Laguna. Prior to my college education, I completed my senior high school at San Beda College Alabang, where I laid the foundation for my academic journey. Throughout my academic career, I have exhibited a commitment to excellence and a drive to expand my expertise in computer science, consistently earning the distinction of being a dean's lister from 2020 to the present.			<br/>
			<br/>
			I gained practical experience as an intern at Cloudlex Software Solutions. I was assigned the role of IT Programmer/Web Developer, working alongside my classmates who were also interning at the company. We were tasked with developing a website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). This project involved creating both frontend and backend components to build a comprehensive web application with a database for senior citizens.
